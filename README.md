# Introduction

In this rapidly changing world, automation is becoming an essential part of almost every industry, be it manufacturing or the healthcare field. When we talk about automation, the first thing that comes to our mind is a robot. Robotics and automation are two distinct technologies but these terms are often used interchangeably. Together, they have tremendously transformed the manufacturing space. Pertaining to the manufacturing world, the most commonly used robot is the Robotic Arm. The Robotic Arm can be used in several manufacturing applications ranging from the assembly line to fault detection and packaging.

</p>

There are two ways of controlling the robotic arm to perform a particular task. A popular method is to use a microcontroller. A microcontroller based Robotic Arm offers programmability. However, this approach is a bit slower as it has to perform memory read/write operations to execute the instructions. Another approach can be to design a custom ASIC package to implement the Robotic Arm task algorithm. Custom ASIC package offers high speed. Nevertheless, it is costly for low volume production and it takes time to get the chip manufactured. A middle path is to use and FPGA to implement the Robotic Arm controller. FPGA offers programmability and is a quick way of getting the prototype ready. It is also the favoured technology for low volume applications.

We have used FPGA approach in our project. We have done prototyping using Nexys4DDR board equipped with Xilinx Artix-7 series FPGA. In addition, we have used SG90 servo motors for actuating the Robotic Arm. Verilog HDL has been used for programming the FPGA. The simulation and FPGA implementation of the design has been carried out using the Xilinx Vivado tool. We have designed a prototype of a Robotic Arm controller with 4-DOF (Degree of Freedom). The proposed arm is designed to operate manually and automatically to perform a particular action.



# Tool Used

### Vivado


<p align="center" width="100%">

   <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65393666/166301464-0940cd42-beb9-418e-937e-fe98b9aa0d58.png">

The Vivado Design Suite is a collection of Xilinx tools for designing, programming, synthesis, and analysis of hardware description language (HDL). It replaces Xilinx ISE and adds new functionality for system-on-a-chip development and synthesis. The Xilinx Vivado High-Level Synthesis (HLS) compiler provides a programming environment that is similar to that found on both regular and specialised processors for application development. For the interpretation, analysis, and optimization of C/C++ programs, Vivado HLS shares key technology with processor compilers. The main distinction is in the application's execution target.

Vivado is an integrated design environment (IDE) featuring system-to-IC level capabilities built on a shared scalable data model and a common debug environment that was released in April 2012. Vivado offers ESL design tools for synthesising and testing C-based algorithmic IP; standards-based packaging of both algorithmic and RTL IP for reuse; standards-based IP stitching and systems integration of all types of system building blocks; and block and system verification. The Vivado Webpack Edition is a free version of the design environment that provides designers with a limited version of the design environment.

Vivado HLS enables a software engineer to optimise code for throughput, power, and latency without having to deal with the performance bottleneck of a single memory area and restricted computing resources by targeting an FPGA as the execution fabric. This enables the incorporation of computationally costly software algorithms into genuine goods rather than merely functionality demos. The same categories apply to application code targeted at the Vivado HLS compiler as they do to any other processor compiler. All programs are analysed in terms of operations, conditional statements, loops, and functions using Vivado HLS.

# Algorithm

As previously stated, the time of the PWM signal sent at the input determines the angle of rotation of a servo motor. Our mission was to control all of the servos independently and from various angles. One servo should not have any effect on another servo.

As a result, based on the demand, the entire code was separated into the following modules:
  1. Top Module
  2. Angle to on-time convertor (RTL_ROM) 
  3. N-bit Parallel In Parallel Out (PIPO) shift register.
  4. PWM Generator Module
  
Fig. 4.2 shows the schematic view of the proposed solution. The concept was to use an Angle to the on-time converter to choose a desired input from the input switch and then transfer the matching on time to a single on-time bus. All of the PIPO shift registers shared the on-time bus. The PIPO shift register was used before each PWM generator to update the on-time of the associated PWM generator only when a CLK trigger pulse was present at the input. When we apply the trigger pulse to a specific PIPO shift, the on-time of the associated PWM generator is updated to the value on the on-time bus at the time. Using this method, we can give any angle to any servo without changing the angles of other servos. Also, an enable signal is used just for each servo for the safety purpose to avoid any conflict. In addition, for the sake of safety, an enable signal is used for each servo.

# Robotic Arm Design

### Mechanical Design

We needed to design a 3 Degree Of Freedom (DOF) Robotic Arm with one joint at the end effector, making a total of four joints. We chose 3-DOF as we wanted to have our Robotic Arm a spherical workspace. As for picking and placing tasks, a wider workspace region is needed, so that the end effector could reach possibly every coordinate in the spherical region.

<p align="center" width="30%">

   <img width="30%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65393666/166309335-d2300cdb-9d5b-44b1-8966-fab6ab997a6f.png">
   
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>Fig.3  DOF Robotic Arm Workspace</b></br>
</p>


All four joints are rotary joints with different range of angles, and are named as :-
1.	Base Joint - The one at the base, its range of angle is 180°.
2.	Elbow Joint - Above the base joint, its range of angle is 90°.
3.	Wrist Joint - Between the Elbow and Gripper, its range of angle is 90°.
4.	Gripper Joint - At the end effector, its range of angle is 30°.

</p>

<p align="center">
<b>Fig.4  Configuration of Joints</b></br>
</p>


### Construction of Robotic Arm

For actuating the joints of the Robotic Arm, SG90 servo motors are used. These servo motors are low cost, low weight and provide pretty precise angle of rotation. Four servo motors are used, one at each joint.
The links of the Robotic Arm are made up of light wooden ice cream sticks, each of appropriate length. These light weighted links are chosen because our servo motors can provide a torque of only upto 1.3 Kg-cm.

</p>

<p align="center">
<b>Fig.5  Actual Mechanical Design </b></br>
</p>


The wires of the servo motors were interfaced to the Pmod connectors of the FPGA board through a Pmod CON3 connector and were powered externally by four 1.5V cells in series (equivalent to 6V). This connector ensured that our servo motors extracted required current from the external power supply. Thus, keeping the FPGA board safe from high load of the motors.

# Conclusion

In this project, we have designed a Robotic Arm and controlled it using FPGA. During this project, our major challenges were to design a mechanical structure of the Robotic Arm and implementation of behaviour of the Robotic Arm on FPGA through Verilog.	

Firstly, we wrote Verilog code to simulate PWM signals with desired specifications to drive servo motors parallelly and with independent angles. We then proceeded to implement the written Verilog code on the FPGA board. In this, the use of the internal clock of FPGA was a challenge for us.

As soon as we got our behavioural design implemented on the FPGA, we started working on designing the mechanical part of the Robotic Arm. The placement and attachment of servos at the joints of or 4-DOF Robotic Arm was a bit challenging. We had to place the servo motors, and decide the amount of rotation, and direction of rotation considering the mechanical restrictions of the joints of the arm.
