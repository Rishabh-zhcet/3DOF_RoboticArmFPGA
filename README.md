# 3DOF_RoboticArmFPGA
This repository contains the details of controlling a 3-DOF robotic arm with 4 servo motors using FPGA. The design is execute using the Nexys-4 DDR Artix-7  FPGA of Xilinx. This repo contails all the files necessary to complete the project such as Verilog code, test bench and constrain file.
